                        <h3>The Road to programming</h3>
                <p>
                    I've always ahd this eye for design and during the course of 2020 I decided to take a new road and start my research as to what I could do in this design category.
                    This is where I came across UX/Ui design.However I was not good at programming as that was one of the requirements for this department.
                    This is when I started a course on Full Stack Development at HyperionDev. I say coding is alot of fun and extremely challenging.
                    While doing this course I knew my goal for UI/UI design was the right path because I spent more time on look of websites rather than making the logical path work properly
